# Arduino Robotic Arm
 
Prototype of a Robotic Arm Control using Arduino.

*I did this project in college, the code isn't polished, but it works.*

---
## Tips
---
    Use Arduino IDE to code and compile the project, also use TinkerCad to test the code.
    You can simulate without the need to have an Arduino and Hardware.
---

## What you will need to do the project:

---
    -> Arduino
    -> Servomotor
    -> LDR Sensor (if you want set alert points to trigger the arm)
    -> Electronic components
